This is my personal website.

The static website will be generated in `./public/`.

## About

This is my personal website, which is a very old project of mine (one of my oldest actually). It already went through 3 refactors!
I started it in high school. I had a lot of fun experimenting with web technologies with it at the time and that's how I got into web development.


This website has been self-hosted on an [ARM board](https://www.olimex.com/wiki/A20-OLinuXino-MICRO) running Debian for a really long time (January 2014 - 17th October 2016).
Eventually I used a professional hosting solution (still on Debian) because my home's power would go out from time to time, which would crash the server.
But at some point I got tired of managing my own server, so it spent a weekend to make it static. On July 17 2019 I moved it to [Gitlab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages/) where it is now.
In July 2023 I converted it to a Hugo site.
